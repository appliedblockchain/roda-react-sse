You can choose one/multiple features to implement, the more the better:

- make the table sortable
- colorize red/green based on the value (for example very red if `price` value is > 200, very green if < 100)
- add c as another random value but this time a random value in this list of names ["Adi", "Mario", "Mike", "Dan", "Danny", "Katrina", "Kristina", "Peter"] (which are the names of the A.B. team members btw)  
- get the weather from an external (cors API) and report the current temperature in degrees celsius
- make the Test button do something (display a modal)
- add tests (Jest runner is already set-up in `client` callable via `npm test` - check https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests for more infos and to configure your favourite matching libraries etc.)
- add another feature you think is good to demostrate your skills
- add some HTML elements and style them (https://bulma.io or custom)
