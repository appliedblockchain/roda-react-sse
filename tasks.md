You can choose one/multiple features to implement based on your liking, the more you do the better, but please re-check the code of your current one before moving to the next one as one feature done well is better than two done incorrectly:

- Make the table sortable [DONE]
- Colorize red/green based on the value (for example very red if `price` value is > 200, very green if < 100) [DONE]
- There are two columns in the table: A, B. Add C as another random value (requires modification of server code in ruby) but this time a random value in this list of names ["Adi", "Francesco", "Mario", "Mike", "Dan", "Katrina", "Kristina", "Peter", "Andy", "Vlad", "Aziza"] (which are the names of the A.B. team members btw) [DONE]
- Get the weather for London, UK from an external (cors API - example: https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast) and report the current temperature in degrees celsius in the page. [PARTIALLY DONE]
- Make the Test button do something (display a modal)
- Add tests (Jest runner is already set-up in `client` callable via `npm test` - check https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests for more infos and to configure your favourite matching libraries etc.) [TESTED - TDD for reducer] [In a real app I would do more testing for views]
- Add another feature you think is good to demonstrate your skills
- Add some HTML elements and style them (https://bulma.io or custom)
- Add React-Router and a second page
